# TYPO3 Roadmap Plugin for TYPO3.org

This plugin will provide records for Majorversions, Minorversions and PHP Versions.

These records will then generate a dynamic, exportable chart (useful in 
presentations) as well as a matrix of compatible PHP versions.

* Make sure to set the estimated releases in each minor version.
* Make sure to set the correct support times in each major version.
